# Personal Pay (working title :wink:)

This is a small Next.js application which allows you to share one link which lets other pay you in multiple different ways.

Currently supported payment methods:

-   SEPA Bank Transfer (QR Code)
-   Stripe (Credit Card, Apple Pay, Google Pay)
-   PayPal Me Link

More ways may be added in the future.

## Setup

Create a .env file of environmental variables based on the .env.example template file.

That's basically it, you're read to go!
